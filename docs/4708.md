本周是围棋诞生十周年。

第一次讨论是在 2007 年 9 月 20 日星期四下午。这导致罗伯特·格里斯默、罗布·派克和肯·汤普森第二天下午 2 点在谷歌山景城园区 43 号楼的雅温得会议室举行了一次有组织的会议。该语言的名称出现在 25 日，几条消息进入了关于设计的第一个邮件线程:
  主题:Re: prog lang 讨论来自:Rob 'Commander' Pike 日期:2007 年 9 月 25 日星期二下午 3:12 致:Robert Griesemer，Ken Thompson 在开车回家的路上，我有一些想法。1.名字叫‘去’。你可以发明这个名字的理由，但它有很好的属性。它很短，容易打字。工具:goc、gol、goa。如果有一个交互式调试器/解释器，它可以被称为“go”。后缀是。去...

(值得说明的是，这种语言叫做 Go；“golang”来自网站地址(go.com 已经是一个迪斯尼网站)，但不是该语言的专有名称。)

Go 项目的生日是 2009 年 11 月 10 日，这一天它作为开源项目发布，最初在 code.google.com，几年后迁移到 GitHub。 但现在，让我们从两年前开始追溯这种语言的概念，这让我们可以追溯到更远的过去，从更长远的角度来看，见证它历史上的一些早期事件。

围棋开发过程中的第一个大惊喜是收到了这封邮件:
  主题:一个 gcc 的围棋前端
发件人:伊恩·兰斯·泰勒日期:2008 年 6 月 7 日星期六下午 7:06 发件人:罗伯特·格里斯默、罗布·派克、肯·汤普森我的一个同事指着 http://.../go_lang.html。这似乎是一种有趣的语言，我为它做了一个 gcc 前端。当然，它缺少了很多特性，但是它可以编译网页上的 prime sieve 代码。 

The shocking yet delightful arrival of an ally (Ian) and a second compiler (gccgo) was not only encouraging, it was enabling. Having a second implementation of the language was vital to the process of locking down the specification and libraries, helping guarantee the high portability that is part of Go's [promise](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat).

尽管他的办公室就在不远的地方，但在那封邮件之前，我们谁也没有见过 Ian，但从那以后，他一直是这种语言及其工具的设计和实现的核心人物。

Russ Cox joined the nascent Go team in 2008 as well, bringing his own bag of tricks. Russ discovered—that's the right word—that the generality of Go's methods meant that a function could have methods, leading to the [http.HandlerFunc](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#HandlerFunc) idea, which was an unexpected result for all of us. Russ promoted more general ideas too, like the the [io.Reader](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader) and [io.Writer](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer) interfaces, which informed the structure of all the I/O libraries.Jini Kim, who was our product manager for the launch, recruited the security expert Adam Langley to help us get Go out the door. Adam did a lot of things for us that are not widely known, including creating the original [golang.org](https://golang.org/) web page and the [build dashboard](https://build.golang.org/), but of course his biggest contribution was in the cryptographic libraries. At first, they seemed disproportionate in both size and complexity, at least to some of us, but they enabled so much important networking and security software later that they become a crucial part of the Go story. Network infrastructure companies like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) lean heavily on Adam's work in Go, and the internet is better for it. So is Go, and we thank him.In fact a number of companies started to play with Go early on, particularly startups. Some of those became powerhouses of cloud computing. One such startup, now called [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), used Go and catalyzed the container industry for computing, which then led to other efforts such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Today it's fair to say that Go is the language of containers, another completely unexpected result.Go's role in cloud computing is even bigger, though. In March of 2014 Donnie Berkholz, writing for [RedMonk](https://redmonk.com/), [claimed](http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2014/03/18/go-the-emerging-language-of-cloud-infrastructure/) that Go was "the emerging language of cloud infrastructure". Around the same time, Derek Collison of [Apcera](https://www.apcera.com/) stated that Go was already the language of the cloud. That might not have been quite true then, but as the word "emerging" used by Berkholz implied, it was becoming true.Today, Go *is* the language of the cloud, and to think that a language only ten years old has come to dominate such a large and growing industry is the kind of success one can only dream of. And if you think "dominate" is too strong a word, take a look at the internet inside China. For a while, the huge usage of Go in China signaled to us by the [Google trends graph](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=golang) seemed some sort of mistake, but as anyone who has been to the Go conferences in China can attest, the measurements are real. Go is huge in China.In short, ten years of travel with the language have brought us past many milestones. The most astonishing is at our current position: a [conservative estimate](https://research.swtch.com/gophercount)  suggests there are at least half a million Go programmers. When the mail message naming Go was sent, the idea of there being half a million gophers would have sounded preposterous. Yet here we are, and the number continues to grow.Speaking of gophers, it's been fun to watch how [Renee French](http://reneefrench.io/)'s idea for a mascot, the Go gopher, became not only a much loved creation but also a symbol for Go programmers everywhere. Many of the biggest Go conferences are called GopherCons as they gather together gophers from all over the world.Gopher conferences are taking off. The [first one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7tQUdRKcyb-k4TMNm2K59-sVlUJumw7) was only three years ago, yet today there are many, all around the world, plus countless smaller local "[meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/golang/)". On any given day, there is more likely than not a group of gophers meeting somewhere in the world to share ideas.

回顾过去 10 年的围棋设计和开发，人们会对围棋界的发展感到震惊。 会议和聚会的数量，Go 项目贡献者的长长的且不断增加的列表， 托管 Go 代码的大量开源库， 使用 Go 的公司的数量，一些独家的:这些都是令人惊讶的。

对于我们三个人，Robert、Rob 和 Ken，他们只想让我们的编程生活变得更简单，目睹我们的工作已经开始，这是一种难以置信的满足感。

未来十年将会怎样？
