# 洋葱:采访“美国最好的新闻来源”——维基新闻，免费新闻来源

> 原文:[https://en . wikinews . org/wiki/The _ Onion:_ An _ interview _ with _ ' American _ Finest _ News _ Source '？UTM _ source = Wanqu . co&UTM _ campaign = Wanqu+Daily&UTM _ medium = website](https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/The_Onion:_An_interview_with_)

**2007 年 11 月 25 日星期日**

尽管许多威斯康辛大学麦迪逊分校(UW)的学生抱有希望，[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Onion "w:The Onion")*洋葱并没有以他们的学生中心命名。“人们总是会问洋葱这个名字*是从哪里来的，”总裁肖恩·米尔斯在接受大卫·尚克本采访时说，“当我最近问创始人之一蒂姆·凯克时，他告诉了我这个名字——我从来没有听说过这个关于‘联合国总部见’的故事——他说他叔叔说他应该叫它洋葱*当他看到他和克里斯·约翰森吃洋葱三明治时。他们真的只是把洋葱切碎，放在面包上。”据编辑部经理切特·克莱姆说，当他们开始报纸时，他们的食物预算是如此之低，以至于他们只能吃白面包和洋葱。***

*早在《每日秀》 和 *[【科尔伯特报道】](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colbert_Report "w:The Colbert Report")* 之前，赫克和约翰逊在 1988 年还是 UW 大学的学生时，就设想过一个模仿新闻和新闻报道的出版物。自成立以来， *The Onion* 已经成为一个名副其实的新闻模仿帝国，拥有印刷版，一个在 10 月份吸引了 500 万独立访客的网站，个人广告，一个 24 小时新闻网络，播客，以及最近推出的名为*我们的哑世界*的世界地图集。艾尔·戈尔和汤米·弗兰克斯将军漫不经心地说出了他们最喜欢的头条新闻(戈尔的头条新闻是《洋葱报》报道他和蒂珀在 2000 年 T21 选举团失败后享受了他们一生中最美好的性爱)。他们的许多作家对乔恩·斯图尔特和史蒂芬·科拜尔的新闻模仿秀产生了巨大的影响。*

*我们很抱歉把这个消息透露给你们这些业余的标题写作者:你们提交的文章甚至都没有被阅读。*

*下面是大卫·尚伯恩对切特·克莱姆和肖恩·米尔斯的采访，内容是关于已经成为洋葱的新闻帝国。*

 *## 洋葱如何写问题

你是如何决定故事的？

**Chet Clem, Editorial Manager:** We do everything backwards here. We start with the headline and then flesh out the story, as opposed to *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "w:The New York Times")*, which writes the issue and then has a headline editor to make it snappy. We start with a joke. We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside—a contributing core. We whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred, come in Tuesday and pick an issue and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff; all fifteen of us. Then we assign a headline to a specific writer to execute. We go through a number of drafts and then have the editors pick it up and assign the [photojournalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photojournalism "w:Photojournalism") aspect of it to our graphic design team, who adds the visual aspect to it. The editors punch it up over the last couple of days and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition.

DS:所以你不需要作家来构思故事和标题，而是由一组作家来选择最佳标题，然后分配给某个不一定参与其中的作家？

**Chet:** Writers will *occasionally* write their own headlines, but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas, what we think will make a good story and then we assign it based upon what people’s writing strengths are. We have some people who are great at politics; some people we give all the war stuff to; someone who is in charge of the [Britney Spears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears "w:Britney Spears") story of the week—the [entertainment stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_journalism "w:Entertainment journalism").

## 头条新闻

编辑部经理切特·克莱姆和总裁肖恩·米尔斯。

**DS:好像有些出版物，像 *[AM New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_New_York "w:AM New York")* ，总是有布兰妮的故事；《洋葱》有什么相似之处吗？他们不断地重温一个话题或一个人。**

**Chet:** No, not necessarily. We are a little less reactionary. We tend to target the [zeitgeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist "w:Zeitgeist") more than anything. We’ll hit the mainstream media’s portrayal of the entertainment world as much as we’ll hit characters in the entertainment world. We’ll attack *[People Magazine’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Magazine "w:People Magazine")* coverage of Britney as much as Britney.

**DS:在与[特里·格罗斯](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gross "w:Terry Gross")的采访中，史蒂芬·科拜尔谈到了他在[第二大城市](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_City "w:Second City")的时光，他说他们已经决定不再制作政治幽默，尤其是老套的政治幽默，比如[泰德·肯尼迪](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy "w:Ted Kennedy")喝酒的笑话。他们觉得这是过度的，卑鄙的，不好笑。你的作家有类似的经验法则吗？**

**Chet:** We don’t have any rules or known lines we won’t cross. We have an understanding based upon having the same writers in the back room for years, and those writers training the new writers as they come in. There is an understanding in the room. If it makes the room laugh, it probably ends up in the paper. One example is we ran an article a couple of years back that was, “No [Jennifer Lopez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez "w:Jennifer Lopez") News Today.” That was our reaction to all of the J-Lo stuff. We weren’t going to touch on her dress, or who she was dating. Just the fact that those were the lead stories for so many days, in everything from *[US Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Weekly "w:US Weekly") to* [Time Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Magazine "w:Time Magazine")*.*

**Sean Mills, President:** I think it’s important we have an original take on those things. I think it’s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross. We don’t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle. There’s a 24 hour comedy news cycle that exists on all the late night talk shows. *The Onion* has a different creative process where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes. We want an original take. If we choose to do something on J-Lo, it’s going to be something like that, something less obvious.

当你浏览头条新闻的时候，是不是只有你们坐在一起试着互相嘲笑？

**Chet:** It’s the least amount of fun possible. Nah, I’m kidding. It’s actually more businesslike than you’d imagine. It’s very much like you are trying to make the room laugh, but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now, so it takes a lot to make the room laugh.

**Sean:** The best analogy I’ve heard is when [Rob Siegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Siegel "w:Rob Siegel"), former [editor-in-chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief "w:Editor-in-chief"), likened it to [wine tasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_tasting "w:Wine tasting"). It’s this quiet experience where you are trying to soak in what the joke is, have we done anything like this, is it a unique take, what are other people doing. It’s sort of like, “Hmmm…that’s hilarious. That’s really really funny” rather than people falling off their chairs. It’s more subdued than I think what most people would expect.

DS:它更具分析性和临床性？

**Sean:** Not all the time, but it can’t be a laugh a minute.

**Chet:** Yeah, what you see on *[Studio 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_60 "w:Studio 60")* and *[30 Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock "w:30 Rock")*, those are scripted writers rooms. Everything is funny there. There's *a lot* of unfunny jokes that are told in a back room, that's why they stay and die in that back room and don’t go out in *The Onion*.

如果有人不停地讲不好笑的笑话，你最终会解雇他们吗？

**Chet:** That’s why we are on the 10th floor to make sure they die when they get kicked out. It can be a real mess on Broadway.

**Sean:** By the time you get to be a writer for *The Onion*, though, the odds are you are going to succeed because we make it pretty challenging. You go through quite a bit. You will already have demonstrated a pretty long successful record of writing stuff for us before you will be in that room on a daily basis. But if somebody wakes up one morning and suddenly no longer is funny, then yeah, head first, out the door as quickly as possible, and as sadistically as possible.

## 特写和专栏作家

DS:“美国之音”指的是街上的哪些人？

**Sean:** Each one of them has their own magnificent story, but they are mainly people from back in the early days of Madison where *The Onion* started. One guy’s a [UPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service "w:United Parcel Service") driver who came by the office; another one was someone they randomly pulled off the street. But they go way back in *The Onion*. Chet might know more.

**Chet:** Way back to the Madison days and they were literally six people on the street that one day, and we have used them ever since.

DS:他们完美地代表了各种各样的人，有趣的是你在一天之内随机地找到了他们。

**Chet:** I wasn’t there at the time, but they were people around the office or around downtown Madison. The UPS driver, for instance, was a guy who always made deliveries to the office, and he happened to come by right when they were shooting and agreed to do the photo. He still works for UPS and still lives in Madison and was the subject of a feature in the UPS [Teamsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamsters "w:Teamsters") magazine about that face in The Onion…our UPS guy, still at UPS and still in Madison.

DS:你听说过这是否影响了他们的生活吗？

**Sean:** There have been a few pieces that I’ve read that people have done research and talked to a lot of them, and most of them are pretty delighted about it and they hear about it all the time. There are six takes on it, but most of it is pretty positive.

[![](../Images/9b7942fe6176c8bdb1db48e5d03d453c.png)](/wiki/File:Herbert_Kornfeld.jpg)

专栏作家

[Herbert Kornfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kornfeld_(character) "w:Herbert Kornfeld (character)")

在一场白人对白人的暴力事件中被谋杀。“几乎有一个

[Notorious B.I.G.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notorious_B.I.G. "w:Notorious B.I.G.")

——就像(读者中的)不安，”切特·克莱姆说。

<sup>Image source: The Onion.</sup>

DS:是否有某些专栏作家是读者的最爱？有没有专栏作家会给你持续正面或负面的回应？

**Sean:** From what I have seen, it’s pretty consistently positive for all of them. The only negative reaction we have gotten is one of our columnists was unfortunately killed this year, tragically, so a lot of people—

**Chet:** [Herbert Kornfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kornfeld_(character) "w:Herbert Kornfeld (character)") was killed this past summer.

他是怎么死的？

**Chet:** He was killed in an episode of white-on-white violence.

**Sean:** He was [accounts receivable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounts_receivable "w:Accounts receivable") and he was pretty hardcore.

**Chet:** He died at work at Midstate Office Supply. He was struck down, leaving us with a hole in our editorial staff.

读者对赫伯特·科恩菲尔德的去世反应很大，你对此感到不安吗？

**Sean:** Yeah, people get pretty attached. A lot of these columnists have been writing for us ten plus years.

**Chet:** Some of them have a huge following, there was almost a [Notorious B.I.G.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notorious_B.I.G. "w:Notorious B.I.G.")-like upset. They really responded to his death. A lot of calls of condolence, there were movements across the country. A lot of flowers.

**Sean:** A lot of people wearing "Mourn Ya Til I Join Ya" t-shirts. His memory will be alive forever at *The Onion*.

**DS:所以没有一个专栏作家会说他们不好笑，或者他们很无聊—**

**Sean:** We have an editorial cartoon we have introduced in the last year that tends to get a lot of heat—

**DS:凯莉？**

**Sean:** That is Kelly. He has a very unique take on what is going on in the world, and it does tend to upset some people, but that’s the job of an editorial cartoonist, to be a provocateur.

**Chet:** That’s right.

**DS:凯莉实际上是[沃德·萨顿](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Sutton "w:Ward Sutton")，对吗？**

**Sean:** It might be…I don’t know…

**Chet:** It’s Kelly. As a newspaper, it’s our responsibility to give equal voice to everyone, so we don’t shut out one viewpoint just because he is controversial.

DS:很长一段时间，那部漫画让我困惑，这也许说明了它的幽默之处。我认为这是一个真正的右翼基督教犹太复国主义者联合漫画家，他真实存在，你们出于一种讽刺的感觉把它放进洋葱里。

**Sean:** We do have one cartoon that runs in the paper called *The Leftersons*, which is a syndicated cartoon from a right wing guy who writes about this lefty family and all the trouble they get in for being so far to the left. But no, Kelly is unique to *The Onion*.

## 新闻摄影

[![](../Images/321639784fc71d4c655397813ed094a6.png)](/wiki/File:Teen_exposed_to_violence.jpg)

《洋葱报》的摄影记者:“他们是奇才。”

<sup>Image source: The Onion.</sup>

DS:你们的图像部门是如何为新闻故事寻找人员并提供图像的？

**Sean:** We’ve always had a two person graphics team and it has always been about—depending on the graphic—going out and finding the right person or creating the right situation. Sometimes taking an original image to a little [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoshop "w:Photoshop") photojournalism to create the right photo and using the photos that are out there.

DS:这些照片是用专业模特还是普通人创作的？

**Sean:** Always people on the street and never professional models. There’s always that element of reality to it.

DS:你是如何接近别人的？你会问他们是否想出现在《洋葱 T2》的文章中吗？

**Chet:** Everyone in this office and our other *Onion* office in the city has been in the paper at least once. Most of their roommates, siblings, loved ones, neighbors, will always end up in there some time. We usually pull them from friends and family of *The Onion*. A lot of our Op-Ed headshots are people who have come to *The Onion*. Our photographers will grab them and ask them to pose for some headshots and tell them they’ll end up in *The Onion* some day. We don’t really use any professional network. It’s casual—people who like *The Onion* and know us.

DS:我最喜欢的一部电影是关于一个问题少年的，他的父母总是在争吵，影片展示了他们射击[双鸟](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bird "w:Double bird")。所以你们的图形部门会搭建场景并指导他们去做？

**Sean:** It could be that, or it could be that they take her pictures and juxtapose it in the photo. It’s directed, though, to get the right effect.

**Chet:** Or it could be an image of a girl who we have had on file, and she’ll be perfect so then we’ll just get someone in the office to shoot the double bird and Photoshop those hands in. They are wizards; I just enjoy watching our crack photojournalism squad work.

## 什么*洋葱*不会出版

DS:当你浏览标题时，你如何决定什么将被充实为一个完整的故事，什么将进入“标题新闻”部分？

**Chet:** Just general writers room feel, what people think needs a full-length story to cover it, and what’s just a one-off funny headline with a photo of a person. There are no real set guidelines of what makes a top story for us, and what makes a neb, it’s just the general support of the staff behind it.

**DS:你遇到过哪些话题，人们几乎总是说，“哦，我们不要这样做，那会进入我们不想进入的领域”？**

**Chet:** Well, we do have a list of no-no words of things that just keep coming up that we refuse to print anything about. There are always some areas where there is a line you don’t want to cross. We *definitely* push that line hard and continuously.

DS:这些是什么？

**Chet:** There will always be the big item controversial issues: [gay rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_rights "w:Gay rights"), [abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion "w:Abortion"), the [war in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War "w:Iraq War"), [pedophilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia "w:Pedophilia"). As long as the joke lands on the right person, then we are okay with it.

你的禁忌语是什么？

**Chet:** It’s a written, top-secret list. I’m afraid I can’t share it with you.

你能给我们两个吗？

**Chet:** “[Thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis "w:Thesis")” and “[Furby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furby "w:Furby")” are both on there.

DS:为什么弗比会在那里？

**Chet:** Again, top secret list. It’s just one of the no-no words.

**Sean:** It’s not like ‘[fuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck "w:Fuck")’, ‘[shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit "w:Shit")’, ‘[cunnilingus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunnilingus "w:Cunnilingus").’ This is a totally different type of no-no that has a logic and [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algorithm "w:algorithm") all to its own.

**Chet:** We can’t say ‘Fuck’ in a front page headline. We’ve been told that by the [U.S. Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Postal_Service "w:U.S. Postal Service").

## 对洋葱故事的反应

**DS:当你的故事被认为是真实的——比如你的故事，关于一个孩子，[在读完《哈利·波特》](http://web.archive.org/web/20000815214418/http://www.theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html)后，决定练习魔法，因为她发现圣经只是一堆“无聊的谎言”—**

[![](../Images/4d776c67c71df1d0ea3d1f022959947d.png)](/wiki/File:Harry_potter_satanism.gif)*The Onion's*

关于儿童求助于

[Satanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism "w:Satanism")

阅读后

[Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter "w:Harry Potter")

书籍被一些基督徒作为真实的故事在互联网上转发。

<sup>Image source: The Onion.</sup>

**Chet:** “Congress threatens to leave DC unless new capitol is built” was run verbatim by a Chinese news agency. With the picture and everything, literally with our illustration.

DS:你对此做了些什么吗，或者你认为这只是歇斯底里？

**Chet:** We’re happy to have our content syndicated by real newspapers in that manner. I want to say it was [a newspaper in Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Evening_News "w:Beijing Evening News"). Somebody pointed it out to them and their response was not to print a correction, but just to say that some newspapers in America make money by printing lies.

**DS:有哪个群体不喜欢*洋葱*？福音派？同性恋？有什么特殊的亚文化吗？**

**Chet:** I think we’re equal-opportunity offenders. We aren’t going to target one group because we don’t want people picketing outside the office. We target everyone.

你收到过恐吓信吗？

**Chet:** Every now and then. We’re generally not bombarded by it.

那些信的主题是什么？

**Sean:** Do you know what I think it is? It’s whatever affects *that* person. So it’s like, “I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer "w:Cancer") and that’s not funny to me.” Or someone else can say, “Cancer’s *hilarious*, but don’t talk about rape because my cousin got raped.” I’m using extreme examples, but whatever it is, if it affects somebody personally they tend to be more sensitive about it. But because we are equal opportunity, we can’t *stop* doing that. The best is we wrote a story—did you ever see the Police Academy when the officer gets thrown off his motorcycle after he brakes really hard and his head goes up a horse’s ass, and he died? We wrote an Op-Ed about that scene that was, “That’s not funny, my brother died that way.” That was sort of speaking to how people are offended by things that touch them personally somehow.

**Chet:** Almost every piece of hate mail starts with the line, “Usually I love The Onion, *but* this time you’ve gone too far…” We responded to that with, “Normally I love your pornographic website, but this time you’ve gone too far…” Someone will *always* be offended by something.

公众人物和政治家对你有什么反应吗？

**Chet:** They are always in the public sphere so they are usually used to worse things being written about them all the time.

**Sean:** We get a lot of *positive* feedback from politicians who seem to get and enjoy the comedy. In some ways, if they show up in The Onion it’s kind of a badge of honor. We had a meeting with Al Gore maybe about a year ago or so, and he was reeling off his favorite Onion headlines that were written about [Al Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore "w:Al Gore"). I think his favorite was, after he lost the election we wrote a story about how Al and [Tipper Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipper_Gore "w:Tipper Gore") were having the best sex of their lives. He referenced it and he said he gets all the headlines sent from people.

他有没有说这个故事非常到位？

**Sean:** He didn’t get into too much detail, which was fortunate. After the Iraq War we had a story about [Tommy Franks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Franks "w:Tommy Franks") leaves the army to focus on solo bombing projects, and he quoted to The Washington Post and others that it was his favorite news coverage ever about him.

**Chet:** We just launched a print edition in DC this year, and the launch party was co-hosted by [Grover Norquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Norquist "w:Grover Norquist") and [Russ Feingold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Feingold "w:Russ Feingold"). So if there is ever a better example of our bipartisan appeal I can’t think of it.

## 总统印章

谈到联邦问题，总统印章的使用情况如何？

**Chet:** The U.S. Postal Service is actually the only federal authority that governs us. We have actually been allowed to use the Presidential Seal since [it was raised as an issue]. Our response was that we felt the federal government had much *bigger* issues on their hands that the President’s counsel should be focused on.

DS:但是你确实要求正式批准使用印章。那是过来了还是在水里死掉了？

**Chet:** We did ask for formal approval; we fundamentally weren’t aware of it at the time it was pointed out to us, but we did go back and get approval for it.

DS:所以你真的得到了批准？

**Sean:** You know, I think, uh, that they were trying to put together on the spot a [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency "w:Federal Emergency Management Agency") that week, and that might have gotten in the way. And then was it that [Scooter Libby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_Libby "w:Scooter Libby") got indicted? Yeah, so I think it’s probably on the bottom of some pile in Washington, but no.

**DS:你一直断言在戏仿中使用不需要正式批准；你只是出于礼貌请求批准？**

**Sean:** Well, I don’t know about the legal side of it, but parody is generally covered and protected by the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment "w:First Amendment") and it is clear what our editorial mission is to our readers, so we did not feel it conflicted with that in any way, so we felt the First Amendment protected us to use it.

**Chet:** And whoever was in charge of filing that paperwork has probably since resigned from the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_House "w:The White House"), so…

## 《洋葱》的读者群

DS:你的读者群是什么？既然你是一份没有固定订户的免费周刊，然后你有了网站和播客，你如何决定你的读者群？

**Sean:** Our website has never been more popular. Just on *The Onion’s* website in October we had over five million unique users as measured by [Omniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniture "w:Omniture"), which is our in-house measurement system. [The AV Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_AV_Club "w:The AV Club"), which is an entertainment site owned by *The Onion*, had over a million for the first time. So our readership has never been stronger. In print we put out 720,000 newspapers every week, and that readership is much harder to manage. Generally speaking, it is assumed that at least three people read each issue on average, so it’s over 2,000,000 there, conservatively. Every joke that gets written in *The Onion*—sorry, every news story—is probably read by 7,000,000 people, somewhere around there.

**DS:类似于*每日秀*和*科尔伯特报告*，你的读者必须被告知要参与其中。你对被视为真正的新闻来源有什么感觉？**

**Sean:** First of all, we enjoy being the most important newspaper in the world and being a trusted news source like that. But I do think we have a really smart readership, so if we can help them learn about the world, that’s a beautiful thing. It’s not necessarily the mission we set out to do, but if that happens in the process that’s a wonderful thing.

**Chet:** We are able to bring some pretty horrific things into the light in a manner that opens it up for millions of people, whereas they may otherwise shy away from it.

## 未来特征

DS:你们总是能推出新的功能，无论是播客、新闻广播还是体育版。现在有正在开发的东西吗？

**Sean:** Yeah, we’re going to soon launch our world atlas on-line. We just debuted Our Dumb World, our new book, and it will then be brought to life on the web and you can access a lot of that content through [Google Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps "w:Google Maps") and [Google Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth "w:Google Earth"), so that will be cool. In January we will be launching our election coverage for 2008, called *War for the White House*. That’s pretty exciting.

**Chet:** We’re really branching out. We’ve covered local and national news for a long time, so we have now branched out to the world with this book. It will give us a chance to bring trusted, non-biased journalism to every nation in the world. I know in [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe "w:Zimbabwe"), for example, most of their media is controlled by the government, so they are really looking for a solid newspaper they can trust.

## 处理国难

DS:当像 9 月 11 日袭击这样的事情发生时，你如何判断什么时候开始通过模仿来解决它？

**Chet:** It’s too soon to answer that question, even! It’s before my time, so I’m hesitant to answer that.

DS:我指的是任何全国性的恐怖事件，比如卡特琳娜飓风。

**Chet:** The issue with Katrina is that it was [Mother Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature "w:Mother Nature")’s fault, but it was the administration’s failure, which was as damaging as the hurricane. So quite quickly government failure and stupidity came to light that needed to be reported upon. We’re going to have a much faster response time to something like that, than something that is like a terrorist attack that catches us out of the blue.

**Sean:** We can talk about issues that are sensitive in a way that aren’t—you have to look at what you are talking about. When you are talking about Katrina, you are talking about the government’s reaction. When you are talking about September 11, if you read our September 11 issues you see, “Bush urges calm and restraint amongst nation’s [ballad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ballad "w:ballad") singers,” or “Woman doesn’t know what to do so she bakes an [American flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_flag "w:American flag").” There was a lot of art to it. With a lot of creative stuff and comedy it’s just gut. It’s the instincts of a really smart and creative editorial staff who have to know both what the take is and how and when to approach it. September 11 was unique. Generally, there’s not a lot of hesitation to approach things. It’s more do we have a take that is consistent with what *The Onion* does, and once that comes to light we publish it.

DS:这更像是一个你们都经历过的本能过程？

**Chet:** Yeah, it is in some way a responsibility to respond to some of this stuff. [Fox News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News "w:Fox News") is not going to go dark after a big national tragedy and just wait it out until they feel it’s “okay” to respond and report on it. There is going to be a little more of a delay because we are obviously a weekly newspaper—daily online—we’re not part of the 24 hour news cycle, but it’s just instinct. Trust your gut to know when is the right time, when is too soon, and is the joke on the right target.

**Sean:** And if other fake news sources, like Fox News, are going after it then we have to respond. It’s just the responsibility we have.

## 洋葱电影和洋葱新闻网

**DS:*洋葱*电影的地位如何？**

**Sean:** Here’s the scoop on that, because I think there is actually a lot of misinformation about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "w:Wikipedia"). There was a movie that was made seven years ago, it was shot, it was a sketch comedy film. One of the producers was [David Zucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zucker "w:David Zucker") and it was made with [Fox New Regency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_New_Regency "w:Fox New Regency") and [Fox Searchlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Searchlight "w:Fox Searchlight"); they were partners in on it, with some first time directors. The movie was shot and the original film was viewed and it was determined by the studio and everyone involved that the material just wasn’t working. They wanted to go out and shoot more, but they needed more money and wanted to start it over. We worked with them to help make that happen, and it became an on-and-off-again project for years and years. Basically, it’s a dead project; however the studio might at some point might try to put something out on DVD to try to recoup what happened. So if it ever comes out, it would come out on home video—

**DS:悄悄地——**

**Sean:** Yeah, probably quietly. Those are the facts of it. There were lots of creative people involved and lots of different opinions on what worked and what didn’t work, and how to proceed, but rising above that fray: basically, the movie was shot, they didn’t want to redo it, it never got re-shot. So it has been sitting on a shelf for over six years. It may or may not make financial sense for the studio, which has the right to put it out on DVD. They may do it, they may not.

**Chet:** We have since redirected our focus from *The Onion* video world to The Onion News Network that launched this past year and has been a great success for us, and expanded The Onion news empire.

**Sean:** That was a major launch for us this year with The Onion News Network. It has been a huge hit. We get over a million downloads a week, which makes it one of the more successful produced-for-the-Internet videos. If we’re not the most successful, we’re one of the most. It is a 24 hour news network. We have a new show that is part of the platform, but we also have a Sunday morning talk show that’s called “In The Know” and we just launched a morning show this last week called “Today Now.” It has been really exciting; we’ll have some new shows, show some archive footage and do some more in sports over the next year.

**DS:洋葱新闻网背后的理念是什么？**

**Sean:** The Onion is a media empire. We have newspapers and a website, so a 24 hour news network makes a lot of sense. Creatively, it is very different from other things that are out there. There are former *Onion* writers and editors that have gone on to have big influence on *The Daily Show* and *The Colbert Report*; the Onion News Network is straight, it’s serious. Those other shows are more like sketch comedy, in a way. They have a host who is a performer. There’s a live studio audience. Everybody is on the joke, there’s voices, there’s faces…it’s very similar to a late-night talk show. Like a Johnny Carson experience. The Onion News Network is 24 hour news. You’re watching what looks like Fox News, CNN and all of our other competitors.

**DS:印刷版的写手和编辑对新闻网络版了解多少？**

**Sean:** The primary writers are separate, but there’s a lot of cross-over and creative influence. The Onion News Network came out of the proud tradition of The Onion and it has been influenced by that. Our editor-in-chief, Scott Dikkers, is the creative force behind both. Some of the actual writers on the paper and the Internet site trade off and go over and submit scripts to the News Network; the News Network writers aren’t really writing for the paper. But there are a lot of people getting in the same room.

**Chet:** We have former *Onion* editor-in-chief [Carol Kolb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Kolb "w:Carol Kolb"), who left *The Onion* a few years back, who has since returned to become head writer of The Onion News Network. So there’s a lot of Onion history there as well.

## 与其他讽刺新闻节目的关系

DS:《洋葱》的许多作者都去了《每日秀》和科尔伯特。你们之间有没有勾结，或者有没有被培养的关系？

**Chet:** There has not been, but I think it will be interesting to see how it will evolve the way you see mainstream media has evolved with people crossing the lines there. Brian Williams on SNL, for example. A lot of cross-over between the different mediums. Who knows what the future holds there. I think as we go between the different satirical news mediums, there might be something fun in the future.

DS:有没有一个故事使工作人员产生分歧，一些编剧回过头来说，“还记得‘老灵魂去鞋匠’和整个问题的*？!"一半人认为这件事不应该发生，而另一半人认为这件事非常棒。*

**Chet:** We are a team, there are almost 15 of us and you are almost never going to get all fifteen people on board behind a joke. Someone is not going to be too hot on it. There are some cases—again, I wasn’t here—but I know the September 11 issue was an obviously very large challenge to approach. Do we even put out an issue? What is funny at this time in American history? Where are the jokes? Do people want jokes right now? Is the nation ready to laugh again? Who knows. There will always be some level of division in the back room. It’s also what keeps us on our toes.

你认为你的作家对美国文化更乐观还是更悲观？

**Chet:** It’s hard to apply the word optimistic to any of our writers. I don’t know if I could classify it like that.

**Sean:** They are great lovers of American culture. I find really enthusiastic support for certain artists, but I don’t know if they sit around thinking about the culture at large, and whether they are optimistic or pessimistic. There are good things every year that come out, and there are bad things that are part of the culture.

**Chet:** Yeah, everyone has their favorite writers, their favorite artists; what they really hate are stupidity and mediocrity. They are really sick of people getting away with repackaged drivel, so they are not going to hesitate to call people out on that. If it’s just another big box sitcom, then yeah we’re going to take a shot at it because it’s not different than every other “Two guys and a child, or a horse, or a donkey, or a monkey, in a two bedroom apartment in New York or Chicago or San Francisco.” Those sort of Madlibs pitches on sitcoms.

## 不请自来的材料

Rory Covey:我很好奇你们会收到多少不请自来的信息？

**Chet:** We have a long history of an editorial policy that we at The Onion are a one-way conduit of information, so the readership exists to be *told* what is news, and we don’t really accept their opinions.

DS:你有十大最差的征求意见清单吗？有人跟踪提交的真正糟糕的东西吗？

**Chet:** Anything really terrible *does* get passed around. I will admit that. But no, we don’t keep track of anything like that.

**Sean:** Unsolicited stuff doesn’t really get read, so it’s hard to make a list.

有没有人因为一次又一次地提交他们不请自来的材料而在*洋葱*出名？

**Chet:** Anyone who continually tells you how funny they are, probably isn’t that funny or we would have recognized it. If they keep pitching over and over, and we’re not taking it, you're probably just not an Onion writer.

DS:你有没有接受过不请自来的想法？

**Chet:** Not that I know of, I don’t think so.

**Sean:** You’re getting ready to pitch something, aren’t you? Let’s hear it…let’s hear it.

DS:你能想象如果我现在拿出一本图文并茂的杂志，里面全是*绝妙的*想法吗？

**Chet:** “What if I had this friend who had this really funny idea about [Velcro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velcro "w:Velcro"), and he wanted me to tell you about that headline. Could I do that?”

DS:“你还记得鲍勃·古尔斯和他的 347 份作品吗？是我干的，混蛋！我很搞笑！看着我的脸，告诉 ME I 我不是！
