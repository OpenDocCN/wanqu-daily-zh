<font>*This is my talk from 2012 [Startup School,](http://startupschool.org/) pretty much exactly as delivered. *

It's been more than 7 years since we started YC. In that time, we've funded 467 startups so I've seen a lot of patterns. There's a talk I always want to give at the beginning of each batch, warning everyone about things that I know are probably going to happen to them. I finally wrote down all my thoughts and I'm going to share them with you now.

We all know that a lot of smart and talented people start startups. You see huge numbers of startups getting started, and yet there are actually only a handful of startups that are big successes. What happens along the way that causes such failure?</font> 

这就像是一条充满怪物的隧道，一路上都在杀死他们。我要告诉你这些怪物是什么，这样你就知道要避开它们。

**<font size="3">决心</font>**

一般来说，你对付这些怪物最好的武器就是决心。即使我们通常用一个词来形容它，决心实际上是两件不同的事情:韧性和动力。韧性让你不会被向后推。驱动力让你前进。创业需要韧性的一个原因是你会被拒绝很多次。即使是最著名的创业公司，在早期也有令人惊讶的被拒绝了。你遇到的每一个人都会对你正在做的事情产生怀疑——投资者、潜在员工、记者、你的家人和朋友。直到你开始创业，你才意识到你过去做出的保守选择得到了多少外部认可。你上了大学，每个人都说，“太好了！”然后你毕业了，在谷歌找了份工作，每个人都说，“太好了！”当你辞职开公司出租充气床垫时，你认为人们会怎么说？

<font>Check out Airbnb's website when they first launched in 2007\. Here's how they describe what they do: Two designers create a way to connect at the IDSA conference. Have you even heard of the IDSA conference? Also, it was only for airbeds!

This is not the sort of thing you get a lot of external validation for. Almost everyone is more impressed with you if you get a job at Google than if you make a website for people to rent out airbeds for conferences.

Yet this is one of the most successful startups. Even if you are Airbnb, you are going to start out looking like an ugly duckling to most people.

When Airbnb did YC back in early 2009, they had already endured tons of rejection. (Check out [Brian Chesky's talk](http://www.justin.tv/startupschool/b/272180383) from Startup School in 2010\. It's one of the most inspirational stories out there.) By the time they came to us, they had maxed out their credit cards. They were eating leftover Capn McCain cereal. They were at the end of their rope.

Everyone thought their idea was crazy at the time—even I did actually—but they knew they were on to something. During YC, they made some key changes to their site, talked to users, set their goals, and measured everything. And the graphs started going up.

Remember that new ideas usually seem crazy at first. But if you have a good idea and you execute well, eventually everyone will see it.

We funded Eric Migicovsky about two years ago when he was working on Inpulse, the predecessor to the Pebble watch. Eric was a single founder and these watches have a quality that terrifies investors—they're hardware.

Poor Eric had a really hard time getting funding. No one wanted to fund a hardware company. He met with lots of investors who'd say things like, "I love the idea. But I can't fund a hardware company." Some claimed they just didn't fund hardware as a rule, others said that there were too many capital expenses up front. They all said no when he showed them the concept.

He'd been building the Pebble based on a lot of user feedback from the Inpulse, and he felt strongly that people wanted this product. So I remember he talked to Paul and they agreed he should give up on investors and put it on Kickstarter. His original goal was to raise $100,000 to make 1,000 watches. Instead of $100,000 Pebble raised $10.2mm in 30 days—the largest amount of money ever raised on Kickstarter. Now they are making 85,000 Pebbles.

Even Y Combinator got rejected when we first started back in Cambridge, MA in the summer of '05\. Now there are lots of organizations doing what we do, but trust me, when we first started, people thought we were crazy. Or just stupid. Even our own lawyers tried to talk us out of it.

But 8 teams of founders took a chance on us and moved to Cambridge and got their $12,000 per team. I think they'd tell you that they had a great experience. We, too, knew we had hit on something interesting</font>. So we focused on making something that a few people loved and we just expanded slowly from there. <font>But it was a slow process.  When we came out to Silicon Valley in the winter of '06 we hardly knew anyone, so we decided to try to meet more investors to convince them to come to Demo Day . I got an introduction to the number one angel in the Valley, Ron Conway. Let me show you how he tried to brush us off.</font>

他说，“这是在波士顿吗？我坚持以本地为主。”我回答说，“不，我们在山景城，我们很希望你能来参加演示日。”他说:“这是投资孵化器的机会吗？”我回答:“不，我们不要你投资我们。这是一个投资个体创业公司的机会。”然后他告诉我们他会绕回来，因为他卡住了。我们收到了 Ronco 的“我现在卡住了”——这太尴尬了。

不过最后一切都解决了。他最终还是来到了演示日，他对自己所看到的印象深刻。一年后，罗恩来到这里，给 07 年冬季的一批创始人做了演讲。

**<font size="3">各种问题</font>**

记住，决心有两个组成部分:韧性和动力。我们已经讨论过为什么你需要弹性:因为每个人都会对你失望。你需要动力来克服你在创业中会遇到的各种各样的问题。有些非常具体——比如一场诉讼或一笔交易告吹——有些含糊不清:没有人访问你的网站，你也不知道为什么。当这些问题出现时，你没有剧本可以参考。你必须随机应变。有时候你不得不做一些看起来不正常的事情。

Rajat Suri 创办 E La Carte 时是麻省理工学院的一名研究生。(E La Carte 允许餐馆顾客通过平板电脑点餐和付款。)他非常投入，以至于找了一份服务员的工作，去了解餐馆是什么样的。

科利森兄弟创立了在线支付处理公司 Stripe。当这些家伙开始工作时，他们是一对年轻的程序员。他们不知道如何与银行和信用卡公司进行交易。

我问 Patrick，“你是如何说服这些大公司与你合作的？”一个有效的技巧是从打电话开始。这样，人们就会注意他们的争论，而不会因为年轻而分心。当他们见面时，这些公司可以看出他们有多年轻，他们已经被深深打动了。

<font>We funded the Lockitron guys back in the summer of '09—that's them at their YC interview. A year after YC, they were still figuring out their idea. They lived with the Wepay guys and one day the Wepays had a party for their investors. By that point the Lockitrons were working on a product to lock your door with an iPhone. They were able to impress one of the investors with their prototype, and he asked to have 40 installed in some startup offices he owned. The founders were psyched, but the commercial locks they needed to use cost $500 a pop. They didn't have $20,000 to fulfill an order that big. So they went around to the local locksmiths and scrapyards, buying broken locks for about $10 each. They fixed them themselves and were able to deliver on that order.

Fast forward a few years later: these guys were ready to launch the newest version of the Lockitron and decided go on Kickstarter. And guess what? A day after Lockitron submitted their campaign, Kickstarter changed their policy about hardware companies and rejected them. The Lockitron guys decided to build their own Kickstarter and they did it in less than a week. They wondered if anyone would even come. Not only did people come, but they've already sold close to $2 million dollars' worth of Lockitrons this way. And they didn't need to give a cut to Kickstarter.

Let me give you one last example of improvising. The Justin.tv founders were having a lot of scaling issues in the beginning. One weekend their whole video system went down. Kyle was in charge of it, but no one knew where Kyle was. And Kyle wasn't picking up his cell phone. This was live video so it was pretty critical that this get fixed immediately.

Michael Siebel called Kyle's friends and found out he was in Lake Tahoe and got the address of the house. So here's a problem for you, you know the address where someone is and he's not answering his phone. How do you get a message to him right away? Michael went on Yelp and looked for a pizza place near the house and called them up and said, "I want to have a pizza delivered.  But never mind the pizza. Just send a delivery guy over and say these four words: The site is down." The pizza place was very confused by this, but they send the pizza guy without a pizza, Kyle answers the door, and the pizza guy says, "The site is down." Kyle was able to fix it, and the site was down for less than an hour total from beginning to end.

**<font size="3">Cofounder Disputes</font>**

Another monster is cofounder disputes. People underestimate how critical founder relationships are to the success of a startup.

Unfortunately, I've seen more founder breakups than I care to count. And when it happens, it can crush a startup.

Be very careful when you decide to start a startup with someone. Do you know them well? Have you worked with them, gone to school with them? Don't slap yourself together with someone just because they are available and seem good enough. You'll probably regret it.

And if you start seeing red flags, do something about it. Don't think that it will go away. It's a red flag when you find yourself worrying whether your cofounder is trustworthy or whether he/she works hard enough or is competent.

When founders break up for whatever reason, it's a blow to the startup's productivity and morale. If there are three and one leaves, it's not so bad, but if there are two and one leaves, that's bad, because now you are a single founder and it's hard to do a startup as a single founder.

**<font size="3">Investors</font>**

Investors tend to have a herd mentality. They like you if other investors like you.

So if no investor likes you until others do, what happens when you talk to the first ones? No one likes you! It's like the catch 22 of not being able to get a job because you don't have enough experience.

You are essentially starting off in a hole and you have to work your way out. You have to meet with lots investors and hear things like "I'd be interested once you have more traction" or "Who else is investing?"

If you work hard enough, you may be able to find a few who are excited enough about you and the idea that they aren't put off by the fact that you don't have any investors yet.  Then when you have a few investors, you can start to make the herd mentality work for you instead of against you. Fundraising is slow and hard until it's fast and easy.

But working to convince those first few investors can be really demoralizing. It's a grind. (There are some really good investors who aren't like this, but the median investor is a herd animal.)

Investors will also drag their feet. Left to their own devices they'll just keep delaying. There's no downside for  them to delay, whereas delay will kill you, because while you are fundraising your company will grind to a halt.

It blows my mind how many successful startups had a hard time fundraising at first. If you remember one piece of advice about investors, it's that you've got to create some type of competitive situation.

I'll give you what has always stuck in my mind as the most amazing example of this: one of the founders of one of our more successful startups had a longstanding relationship with a VC. When the founder started the company and did YC, this VC kept in touch through the 3 months, not really doing anything except keeping a benevolent eye on him. The VC attended demo day, but didn't invest. After a few months, the startup got a termsheet from a prestigious VC. When the first VC heard about this, he shifted into panic mode. He faxed the founder a termsheet from his firm with the valuation blank and said, "Fill in whatever valuation you want and we're in."

There are worse things investors can do to you than just delay. Sometimes they say yes and then change their mind. It's not a deal till the money is in the bank. We've seen some founders learn that they hard way.

I could tell you a lot of horror stories to frighten you, but just remember that fundraising is a bitch.

YC founders get to raise money under the best of circumstances and even for them it's a bitch.

**<font size="3">Distractions</font>**

One of the reasons fundraising can be so damaging to your company is that it's a distraction.

We warn everyone early on at YC to be very careful about distractions. Nobody is stupid enough to get distracted by things that aren't work-related, like playing video games. The kind of distractions founders fall for are things that seem like a reasonable way to spend their time.

We tell people that during YC there are really only three things you should focus on: building things, talking to users, and exercising. Maybe this is a bit extreme, but the point is that early on in a startup all that matters is figuring out how to make something people want and doing it well. Don't spend all your time networking. Don't hire an army of interns. Just build stuff and talk to users. 

(BTW, fundraising is a distraction, but it is necessary. So just try to spend as little time on it as possible.)

One thing that isn't necessary, and is a bad distraction, is talking to corporate development (or corp dev) people. These are the people at big companies who buy startups. You get a call from a corp dev person and they want to learn more about what you are doing and explore possible ways of working together. The founder thinks, "Oh boy, this important company wants to work with me. I should at least take a meeting."

I hate to sound harsh, but what these meetings really are for is for them to see if they want to do an HR acquisition.

**<font size="3">HR Acquisitions</font>**

An HR acquisition means a company is essentially trying to hire you. (They are such a dangerous distraction that they get their own little monster!)

There's nothing wrong with HR acquisitions, if that's what you want to do. But most founders don't start startups just to go get a job a big company with what amounts to a nice hiring bonus.

Talking to corp dev early on isn't just a waste of time, it's uniquely demoralizing. I see this cycle happen over and over: the founders go to meet the corp dev people and think the meeting went great. They seemed so friendly and enthusiastic. The founders delude themselves into thinking that their startup is going to be the one that gets bought for $10 million after only 5 months. The founders start to think, "Yeah, we'd kind of like to get acquired," and then they start not to work on their startup as much and they lose momentum. Then they get the offer and it's essentially what they would have gotten if they walked in off the street and got a job. But by then they've gotten so accustomed to the idea of selling that they take it.

So going down the corp dev road seriously can deflate your ambitions. HR acquisitions are what you do when you are failing. Don't pull the cord on your inflatable life raft until your ship is actually sinking!

**<font size="3">Making Something People Want is Hard</font>**

Now we come to the fiercest monster of all: the difficulty of making something people want. It's so hard that most startups aren't able to do it. You are trying to figure out something that's never been done before.

Not making something people want is the biggest cause of failure we see early on. (The second biggest is founder disputes.)

In order to make something people want, being brilliant and determined is not enough. You have to be able to talk to your users and adjust your idea accordingly. Ordinarily you have to change your idea quite a lot even if you start out with a reasonably good one.

Remember the first Airbnb website? Airbedandbreakfast was a rather narrower idea when they first launched. They started out as a site that let people rent out airbeds to travelers for conferences. Then they changed to renting out airbeds. Then they changed to renting out a room or a couch, but the host had to be there to make breakfast. Then finally they realized there was pent up demand to rent out entire places.

This evolution shows that you may begin with a general vision of what your startup is doing but you often have to try several different approaches to get it right.

Sometimes you have to totally change your idea. OrderAhead (which lets you order takeout on your cell phone) was the founders' 6th idea.

Even if you don't need to change the overall idea much, you still tend to have to do a lot of refinement. One of the best examples of this is Dropbox.  Drew and Arash were working on something that was obviously necessary, but the reason it was hard to predict early on whether they'd succeed is that there were lots of people doing this.  The way to win in this world was to execute well. It didn't just happen overnight; they had to get 1001 details right. There were a lot of unglamorous schleps between this photo:</font>

<font>**<font size="3">过山车</font>**

从创办公司到登上《福布斯》封面，你会经历一些戏剧性的起伏。在一家初创公司，你不像在大公司那样有阻尼。环境摆布你。这个过程通常被描述为过山车，因为你前一分钟还在上升，下一分钟就下降了。许多跌宕起伏的故事都与筹款有关。我所知道的最极端的例子之一发生在我们资助的一些人之前的创业公司。该公司总部位于德克萨斯州，他们从硅谷的一家顶级风投那里拿到了一份条款清单。条件之一是他们把公司设在海湾地区。因此，创始人卖掉了他们的房子，把他们的家搬进了德克萨斯州的公司住宅，直到他们在硅谷找到了新的地方。文件已经签署，钱预定在星期五电汇。他们打算周一在风投办公室开始工作。于是星期五到了，出于某种原因，钱没有汇过来。他们打电话给 VC，问要不要出来。风投说:“是的。当然！”他们坐上自己的小货车，从德克萨斯州开往硅谷，在拉斯维加斯停下来庆祝(这是过山车的上升部分)。

周一，他们在风投基金的会议室里摆好了自己的东西——团队的 6 个人都在那里工作。到那个星期三，资金还没有汇过来。他们计划当天召开董事会，并邀请了风投。

在这次会议中，首席执行官谈到了注册人数暂时下降的原因，因为他们改变了衡量注册人数的方式。你知道这个故事会有怎样的结局...风投实际上已经得到了买家的后悔，他以此为借口来破坏交易。记住，他们已经签署了所有的文件，卖掉了他们的房子，搬到了硅谷，只等着收到汇给他们的 700 万美元。相反，风投放弃了。他把他们赶出了会议室。创始人们不得不把他们在德克萨斯州的妻子叫回来，夹着尾巴回去。他们不得不解雇所有人。你能想象吗？就在几天前他们还在拉斯维加斯庆祝，现在他们什么都没有了。(顺便提一下，为了得到一个如此极端的故事，我们不得不使用一个我们没有资助的创业公司的例子。风投可能不会对我们投资的初创公司这么做。)

现在让我告诉你另一半的过山车:

我们在 2011 年夏天资助了 Codecademy 团队。他们最初的想法行不通，他们不断探索新的想法。直到 7 月下旬，他们才开始研究教人们在线编码的想法。他们在演示日的前三天发布。在那 3 天里，他们有超过 20 万的用户。他们推出产品只是为了在展示日那天站起来说他们是一家上市公司。他们从来没有想到，在短短 3 天内，他们可以从一个没有推出想法的初创公司变成一个可以登上舞台并宣布拥有 20 万用户的初创公司(这几乎是你能对投资者说的最激动人心的事情)。这里的主题是事物可以有多极端。请记住，没有极端会持续下去。当事情出了差错时，不要让自己因悲伤而动弹不得。只要一步一步地往前走，就知道会好起来的。但是，当事情进展顺利时，不要自满。事实上，事情从来没有看起来那么糟糕或那么好。让过山车更糟糕的是，当你在上面的时候，有一个观众在看着你做的每一件事。你会被网络流氓和记者说你的坏话。所以做好这个准备，脸皮厚一点。

**<font size="3">辛苦，但并非不可能</font>**

大家都知道创业很辛苦。然而，当我们看到人们这样做时，他们总是感到惊讶。

他们感到惊讶的原因是他们没有意识到这些具体问题可以有多糟糕。我见过一些非常聪明和有才华的人变得如此沮丧，以至于他们放弃了。

创业不适合胆小的人。我知道这不是什么新消息，但我希望你至少能在早期了解它们有多难，这样当你遇到这些特定的怪物时，你就知道该怎么做了。</font>T45
