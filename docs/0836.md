Dear readers, let's take a moment for poetry:

// Based on Ulysses
// Alfred Lord Tennyson - 1809-1892
// patched by FX of Phenoelit - still alive

It little profits that an idle king,
By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
Matched with an aged drive, I mete and dole
Unequal laws unto a savage race,
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.

I cannot rest from travel; I will drink
Mate to the lees: All times I have enjoyed
Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when
Through scudding disks the rainy Hyades
Vext the dim screen. I am become a name;
For always roaming with a hungry heart
Much have I seen and known - code of men
And manners, climates, councils, governments,
Myself not least, but honored of them all, -
And drunk delight of battle with my peers,
Far on the ringing plains of shady toys.
I am a part of all that I have met;
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'
Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades

For ever and for ever when I move.
How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!
As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life
Were all too little, and of one to me
Little remains: but every hour is saved
From that eternal silence, something more,
A bringer of new things; and vile it were
For some three Suns to store and hoard myself,
And this gray spirit yearning in desire
To follow knowledge like a sinking cloud,
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

This is my son, mine own Telemachus,
To whom I leave the keys to my drive,
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill
This labor, by slow prudence to make mild
A rugged people, and through soft degrees
Subdue them to the useful and the good.
Most blameless is he, centered in the sphere
Of common duties, decent not to fail
In offices of remoteness, and pay
Meet adoration to my hacking gods,
When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.

There lies the port; the parser puffs his sail;
There glooms the dark, the broad C Software majors,
Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me -

That ever with a frolic welcome took
The thunder and the Sun-Shell, and opposed
Free hearts, free foreheads - you and I are old;
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.
Death closes all ports; but some things never end,
Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.
The lights begin to twinkle from the racks:
The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,

'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Push constants to the stack machines, 
And sitting well in order smite
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the VM stacks, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the GOOG will wash us down;
It may be we shall touch the Hasty Likes,
And see the great Turing, whom we knew.

Though much is taken, much abides; and tho'
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, 
we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find,
and not to yield [control].
