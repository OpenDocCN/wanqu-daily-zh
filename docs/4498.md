# 加密货币的网景时刻

正如 [网景](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) 的 IPO 标志着互联网时代的真正开始，2017 年将是风险投资、对冲基金以及最终普通消费者广泛参与加密货币及相关协议和资产的发令枪。

最近 [加密货币](https://startupboy.com/2014/04/01/the-fifth-protocol/) 的估值飙升，引起了企业家和投资者对加密技术的突然而深远的兴趣[1]。2013 年 12 月，人们对比特币的兴趣出现了类似的飙升。当时，比特币价格上涨了 10 倍，达到 1000 多美元，随后暴跌至 200 美元左右。虽然 2013 年的兴奋很大程度上是短暂的，但这一次感觉不同。

 **那么到底发生了什么变化？**
现在是 crypto 的“网景时刻”有多重原因:
 **1 .价值存储(又名黄金替代品)用例正在成为现实。**
比特币刚推出的时候，被不屑一顾的当成了 [玩具](http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/) 。当每枚 BTC 价值 25 美分时，人们会把它们作为新奇的东西送给对方。
最近，比特币已经成为一种合法的黄金替代品和对冲黄金波动的工具。我从多个对冲基金那里听说，在过去的 6 个月里，他们没有看到他们所预期的“避险”情况下的黄金价格变动。相反，比特币的走势与他们之前对黄金的预期一致。比特币正在慢慢扮演黄金(以及黄金公司股票)在对冲策略中曾经扮演的角色的数字版本。将 BTC 作为大规模黄金替代品的一大障碍当然是其固有的波动性。有越来越多的家庭用比特币汇回资金或人们跨境旅行的轶事。它是你可以储存在大脑中并跨越国界的唯一资产
正如黄金之外还有其他贵金属价值储存一样，还有其他加密货币正在成为市场的潜在白银和铂金。目前的竞争者有 [莱特币](https://litecoin.org/)[Zcash](https://z.cash/)[Monero](https://getmonero.org/home)【3】。
**2。新的区块链、技术和应用不断涌现，使加密市场不断增长。几年前，BTC 是城里唯一的游戏。虽然作为一个资产商店很棒，但 BTC 有许多限制，使得开发人员更难使用，也限制了它的应用。例如，很难使用不完全的脚本语言。BTC 是有目的地设计的限制，允许它有效地作为一个价值商店。以太坊通过提供一种图灵完整的类似 javascript 的脚本语言，以及将自己定位为分布式通用计算机而不是分布式货币，克服了这些限制。以太坊 允许在其上构建许多更复杂的应用程序。以太坊智能合约的主要应用之一是它能够为许多其他令牌和 ico 供电[4]。这将包括计算(以太坊)、存储([Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/)——一种具有 [再现性证明](http://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf) 和时空证明相对于 BTC 工作证明的加密货币)以及电网、wifi 等项目。

大量新的加密协议、应用程序和令牌，以及 Litecoin、Monero 和 Zcash 等更新的加密货币，激发了最近开发者和投资者的兴趣。在互联网模拟中，Mosaic 和后来的 Netscape 让人们更容易访问互联网，催生了一批新的创业公司(Google、Amazon、PayPal)，也让一批新的开发者参与进来，开发出数百万人可以访问的应用程序。类似地， [BTC 的白皮书](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) 和 codebase 导致了一整套全新的加密项目，它们有自己的用例及应用。虽然其中许多还没有被证实，但这项技术还有很大的应用空间。T81** 

**3\. New ways and infrastructure to monetize and raise money for crypto technology.**
Ethereum smart contracts[6] enabled new crypto projects to crowdfund tens of millions of dollars to fuel their development and growth. These [token sales](https://medium.com/@balajis/thoughts-on-tokens-436109aabcbe) are often implemented as smart contracts running on Ethereum. The ability to raise tens of millions of dollars in non-dilutive capital via an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) means that (a) some crypto efforts can avoid ongoing dilutive venture capital, (b) crypto efforts may be monetized quickly and (c) we are likely to see a fair amount of speculative investing and potentially abuse of these instruments (See SEC early response [here](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings)).

The ability to raise non-dilutive capital, and in some cases cash out early, will drive a gold rush mentality as well as a fair amount of financial speculation. [Coinlist](https://coinlist.co/) is an interesting new tool in this area.

**4\. Outside of crypto and ML, there are few good entrepreneurial markets right now.**[Every technology cycle](http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/07/end-of-cycle.html) include a period of mass focus on a handle of key areas (social, mobile, machine learning etc.). [Some of these movements result in massively outsized companies](http://andrewchen.co/growth-is-getting-hard/) (Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Uber, etc.) and others fizzle out (location services, nanotech, energy 2.0). As we end one investment/entrepreneurial cycle there is often a gap in clear areas to work until the technology world hits on the next interesting area. Right now there is a major lull in mainstream software innovation. 
Given a dearth of alternative interesting large-scale markets and technologies to work in, entrepreneurial activity has accelerated in this market.
**5\. Some people got rich [7].**
Cryptocurrency stands out as an area of interest in part due to all the people who suddenly made a lot of money in the price run up of the last 6 months. As people make tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, entrepreneurs, investors and press take notice. A lot of people are going into crypto out of ambition, greed, or simply because it seems increasingly de-risked due to ICOs and price rises.

**6\. Capital inflows.**
We still live in a low interest rate world, with few good places for investors to deploy capital. While most institutional and consumer capital has been sitting on the sidelines for cyptocurrencies, it is now easier then it has ever been to buy and store these assets thanks to companies like Coinbase/GDAX and Kraken. Increased ease of trading in turn has driven recent adoption on a global basis.

To date, institutional investors and hedge funds have largely stayed on the sidelines. In part this is due to a lack of tools for institutions to invest and hold crypto. It is also driven by the conservative nature of most of these investors, with [Abigail Johnson from Fidelity](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-ceo-bringing-blockchain-to-the-masses-harder-than-it-seemed-1495548000) as a notable counter. Once large institutional investors inevitably move off of the sidelines and into crypto, there will be a large run up in valuation of currencies (and given the lack of savyness, probably a bunch of crap tokens will also get temporarily expensive too - see e.g. last internet bubble).

With the recent run up, [over a dozen crypto hedge funds](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/07/12/crypto-boom-15-new-hedge-funds-want-in-on-84000-returns/#6560b51e416a) have been founded[5] since [Metastable](http://fortune.com/2017/07/26/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-hedge-fund-sequoia-andreessen-horowitz-metastable/). This incremental capital coming into the industry should make the recovery from the recent crypto crash occur much faster then in 2013\. However, if the past is any guide to the future, it is highly likely there will be at least one or more major corrections (e.g. 10-90% drop) in crypto prices on the way up. It is going to be a volatile and bumpy ride.
 **Summary**
Cryptocurrencies are having their Netscape moment. Unlike December 2013, this time there is sustainable entrepreneurial and investor interest. Bitcoin has started to prove itself out as a gold alternative. New protocols and blockchains are driving a burst of innovation as well as ease fundraising via ICOs. A lack of non-crypto entrepreneurial opportunities is also driving people in. While there is a long way to go to prove out many non-currency applications, this technology and its implications are here to stay.

**NOTES**
[1] There are of course those who have been bullish for years now, like Naval Ravikant, Fred Wilson, Chris Dixon, Balaji Srinivasan, etc.

[2] As a random aside, I think if Satoshi Nakamoto had been a more traditional public person or founder, crypto would have been embraced by the investment community more quickly. Absent a public figurehead to run on the cover of Fortune, crypto took longer to catch on with investors than it might have.

[3] Litecoin differs from BTC in that it is memory-hard proof-of-work versus BTC CPU-hard proof-of-work approach. Zcash and Monero have extra aspects of anonymity that differ from BTC.

[4] Ethereum smart contracts have been abused in the past, [leading to the split between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC)](http://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-classic-explained-blockchain/). (Hint: if you hold one consider ETH. By the way, none of this post is meant as investment advice. I am a naif in this area so do your own research.)

[5] Although a number of crypto teams are still raising seed rounds and or [SAFT](https://medium.com/@rzurrer/coinlist-the-saft-the-imperitive-of-blockchain-token-compliance-f5ce9cdbc238)s to fund initial white paper design and eventual build out.

[6] The fact that many token sales are via Ethereum smart contracts is one reason ETH value has grown rapidly.

[7] This definitely seems to be the biggest driver of new VCs entering the market.
