*“谁能忘却我所知道的一切”*

 **T4】**

看待出版商的商业运作链的一种方式是，它必须做五件核心的事情:(1)生产内容；(2)营销/推广内容；(3)分配；(4)为其内容找出最佳的用户界面或体验；(5)将业务货币化。这实际上适用于任何出版商:例如内容和商业。因此，为了最大化最终用户体验和价值，以及由此产生的企业价值，公司需要最大化其跨这些组件交付的能力。当然，技术将它们都融合在一起。T3】

  One way to accomplish this was suggested by [Chris Dixon last year](http://cdixon.org/2014/03/15/full-stack-startups/). He called it the “full stack startup”:  

“新的方法是建立一个完整的、端到端的产品或服务，绕过现有的公司。。。你需要擅长许多不同的事情:软件、硬件、设计、消费者营销、供应链管理、销售、合作伙伴关系、监管等。”

“You need to get good at many different things” being the key proposition.  But maybe, a year or so later, we are seeing something different emerging. Something closer to the actual unbundling of content and commerce businesses themselves from the web at large (and the apps thereto). The unbundling of the full stack startup. Where instead of being good at many things, companies can just focus on the last mile of value they provide, the one thing they can excel at better than anyone else. Maybe this should be called the No Stack Startup - services that can focus on doing only one thing - hopefully well - and utilize other services for everything else.  This is not totally new but is challenging some of established orthodoxy by assuming there are some things - design for example - that may not be core competencies.  Some examples made me think of this:

> [The Shade Room](https://instagram.com/theshaderoominc/)——一家基于 Instagram 的娱乐发行商，只做内容采购和制作

> [斯蒂芬的头](http://stefanshead.com/)——一家基于文本的商务公司，它只设计产品，并在前端使用 Twilio(我认为)和后端使用 Stripe，通过短信发送其报价

> [](https://www.techinasia.com/these-chinese-college-students-built-a-business-selling-fruit-on-wechat/)——微信运营的水果卖家

> [TextRex](http://textrex.co/) -餐厅推荐结束短信

Some characteristics all these share is that they use other platforms and APIs (or protocols, in the case of SMS) to cobble together a service and in doing so rely almost wholly on those platforms and APIs for every function of the business other than the one they can be the best at. And, maybe more importantly, they all are using those other platforms to define their users experiences.   Take Facebook, for example. At some level, the Facebook is a very good platform to market, distribute, promote, and - now, maybe - monetize content on. The UX is well known to its users - and optimized over years through billions of interactions for commenting and sharing. In this way, Facebook performs 4 of the 5 components listed above. All, except making the content itself. Similarly, take other platforms, [such as Instagram](http://moussemagazine.it/articolo.mm?id=994): “如果你有一个 Instagram 账户，你可以给任何东西贴上价格标签，给它拍照，然后卖掉它。例如，你可以拿着这罐圣佩莱格里诺，把它涂成粉红色，放上一颗心，称它为你的，并宣布出售。连我奶奶都有 Instagram 业务！她卖干果。一个朋友的表弟在卖奇怪的盆栽植物，用的是人造草皮。人们正在创造，你知道，被黑的产品。”

These No Stack businesses may not offer a “great experience” (traditionally defined) but they likely are “good enough” (see [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/the-emerging-global-web) for a great overview of how this is happening in Asia).  Of course, most of these are not even "mobile-first" businesses - they are "mobile-only". They often don’t even have web sites (or, apps for that matter): "the homepage once conferred some sense of reaching your canonical destination, it’s now your name on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Amazon etc. that consumers are searching for” ([Jonathan Libov](http://whoo.ps/2015/04/24/destination-everywhere)).

从历史上看，总是有服务和 API 将功能串联在一起。直到最近，其中大多数都是后端基础架构类型。

现在感觉好像还有其他事情在发生。首先，后端服务已经变得非常非常好，非常多样化(参见 Stripe、Twilio、Shippo、Kabbage、Ziggeo、Layer，这只是涵盖支付、消息、运输、融资和视频的几个例子)。

此外，无堆栈服务还利用了其他位于后端服务之上的前端。他们使用的前端可能不是最初为这些目的设计的。但它们之所以有效，是因为在许多方面，它们都是经过市场检验的最佳用户体验。

The No Stack Startup thus does not attempt to recreate a user experience, instead relying on other UX that are good enough, and getting better. This obviously inverts the notion of user experience and even design (my partner Albert's great [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8qo7pzH_NM) is all about inversions in fact).  Even better, in relying on the UX of other platforms, the No Stack Startup also relies on the users of those platforms. In some ways, and [to paraphrase Jeff Bezos](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/09/09/the-25-smartest-things-jeff-bezos-has-ever-said.aspx), this new class of services looks at other platforms, builds upon them, and thinks: "your users are my opportunity."

我一直在试图弄清楚这可能意味着什么。几个点子:

> *平台本身可能会有不同甚至比之前想象的更强的网络效应(虽然方式不同)，作为其他服务的跳板

> *感觉现在是一个利用新兴的无堆栈技术成为有创造力的 企业家的绝佳时机，尽管 it 完全不清楚如何通过全堆栈方法来衡量无堆栈方法的可持续性

> 现任出版商的竞争环境更加激烈，反馈循环比我们想象的更快。

Regardless of the implications, it seems that when there is continuously less "there" needed to create value, we might at a minimum require some new definitions.
