卡片是存放信息的小巧容器。当涉及到平衡清晰的美学和简单的可用性时，它们几乎成了默认选项。首先由 Pinterest 和脸书等服务引入，如今卡片的影响正在向多个行业扩散。

Pinterest introduced the idea that all the most relevant information about a single topic can be organized into a single container.

Implemented correctly, cards can improve the UX aspect of an app. In this article, I’ll desribe 5 useful techniques for cards and provide some helpful examples.

# 1.遵循“一张卡，一个概念”的原则

一张卡片上的所有内容应该只与一个想法相关。卡片可以在一个设计中包含多个元素，但每个元素只应关注一位信息或内容。这让用户有机会选择他们想要消费或分享的部分内容。

#2\. Make the Entire Card Clickable Follow the [Fitts’s Law](https://designmodo.com/size-space-interaction-design/) and allow the user to click/tap any part of the card, not just the text link or image. Larger touch zone substantially improves usability on both touchscreen devices and mouse-based devices.

**提示:**卡片使用轻微的阴影来表现深度很好，这是[可点击性](https://babich.biz/graphical-user-interface-as-a-reflection-of-the-real-world-shadows-and-elevation/)的*视觉能指*。

#3\. Make Card Visually Pleasing What makes cards work is *good design and great usability*. By giving cards a bit of aesthetic polish, your card design feels familiar yet still creative. ![](/content/images/2016/12/1-Zend4eGxVNQvI2JzdHiaXQ.png)

When it comes to the actual design of cards, you’ll need to focus on following moments: ##Images Going heavy on images is a strength of card-based design. Studies [confirm](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/boost-conversions-using-images/) that images elevate design. Thus, emphasis on using images makes card-based design more attractive to users. ![](/content/images/2016/12/1-ssRR-KGQqf1pV1XpgssM1Q.png)

##Shadows and Gradients Shadows and gradients go a long way in making users relate to the cards as they would with their physical counterparts. But consider carefully how you use shadows and gradients: if the shadows are cast at all corners and sides, then the illusion of card being a physical object is ruined. ![](/content/images/2016/12/1-Mf0aym54b9oECX887u-JWw.png)

##Typography You can also draw users’ attention with the use of text. Everything about a card design should be easy to read and understand. You should design for maximum readability:

*   选择[简单的字体](https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/xd-essentials-typography-in-mobile-apps/)和易于阅读的配色方案(当文本放在与文本有足够对比度的纯色背景上时，最容易阅读)。
*   尽量限制字体的数量。对于大多数卡片项目，单一字体就足够了。

提示:正常粗细的无衬线字体非常适合复制卡体。

#4\. Limit Content in Card *A card is usually short and offers a linked entry point to further details, rather than the full details themselves.* When you try to put into a card too much content, to the point that the card starts to get too wide or too long, it loses its original metaphor since it doesn’t look like a card anymore.

下面你可以看到一个基于卡片的用户界面的例子。注意中间的卡片。这里的问题是，它充满了信息，这使得它很难扫描。

#5\. Take Advantage of Animation and Movement Animation can contribute heavily to the user experience if used correctly. It helps people orient themselves within the card-based interface and establish visual relationships between different states for each card. ##Visual Hints Visual hints assist users to better understand how to interact with user interface. This type of animation is used when you need to demonstrate how certain functionality in the design operates. ![](/content/images/2016/12/1-KKNXOobR_qc88scQsxtmQA.gif)

##Visual Feedback Visual feedback is extremely important in UI design. It works because it appeal to the user’s natural desire for *acknowledgement*. In real life, objects respond to our interaction, and this is how people expect things to work. For desktop apps or sites you can use hover effect to show that the element is interactive. Hover animation adds a level of discoverability, and at the same time makes the experience more fun. ![](/content/images/2016/12/1-1W9CoUnqJ2VOyr7IBhsGXg.gif)

Using hover effect you can also reveal options. In example below hover effect allow user to make color tagging, reply, forward or delete message. ![](/content/images/2016/12/1-5BJrfstU6UvIpxsfAZJ5WQ.jpeg)

##Zoom In This animation creates a transition between preview and detailed view: a user selects an item (card) and immediately sees a detailed information that is associated with that selection. The challenge here is to make sure the user feels they are stay in the given context. ![](/content/images/2016/12/1-HTwAAZufpECUGrpxo5yejA.gif)

#Conclusion *Cards are then new creative canvas.* They are more than just a look, cards are one of the most flexible layout formats for creating rich content experiences.
