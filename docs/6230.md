谢谢理解。

好吧，这是简单的版本。如果这回答了你的问题，那太好了。

更详细的回答是“不，我不会指导你，但在这篇博客中，我会告诉你该做什么，去你想去的地方”。下次有人请求指导时，我可以回复这篇文章的网址。

我曾经在《黑客新闻》上写了一篇评论，讲述了我从优秀导师身上学到的东西。给你，稍微编辑了一下，这样读起来会好一点。

(记者问)

*Recently I have tried approaching a few good developers through their blogs about various matters including advice on how to go about some projects I'm undertaking but I am surprised at the unfriendly responses I have received. Maybe I have been going about it the wrong way but it got me thinking; Shouldn't the guys whose work we look up to be keen on what some of us young aspiring developers have to contribute to the community? I mean sure, we don't have the experience or skills some of these guys have(yet) but we still have some ideas that are viable with the right technical skills to back them. If any of them want to reach out and help nurture some potential talent, it may very well benefit all them in the end, whether financially or in terms of new ideas and experiences.*

我这样评论道

*I have some experience in this, so let me try to explain a couple of things that I learned in the "school of hard knocks".

Once upon a time I was in a situation where I thought I could contribute to something one of the best programmers in the world was working on so I sent an email (I got the address from his webpage) and said something to the effect of " you say on this webpage you need this code and I have been working on something similair in my spare time and I could write the rest for you over the next few months because I am interested in what you are doing" and I got a 2 line reply which said (paraphrased) " A lot of people write to me saying they'll do this , but I've never seen any code yet so I am a little skeptical. Don't take it personally. Thanks. bye.".

So in the next email (sent **a minute after I received his reply**) I sent him a zipped file of code with an explanation that "this is what I've done so far which is about 70% of what you want" and he immediately replied saying "Whoa you are serious. That is refreshing .. ' and opened up completely, giving me a lot of useful feedback and very specific advice. He is a (very valued) mentor to this day.

Another time, I was reading a paper from a (very famous) professor at Stanford, and I thought I could fill in some gaps in that paper so I wrote a "You know your paper on X could be expanded to give results Y and Z. I could use the resulting code in my present project. Would you be interested in seeing the expanded results or code" email and I got a very dismissive one line email along he lines of " That is an old paper and incomplete in certain respects, Thanks".

So a few days later, I sent along a detailed algorithm that expanded his idea, with a formal proof of correctness and a code implementation and he suddenly switched to a more expansive mode, sending friendly emails with long and detailed corrections and ideas for me to explore.

Now I am not in the league of the above two gentlemen, but perhaps because I work in AI and Robotics in India,which isn't too common, I receive frequent emails to the effect of "please mentor me", often from students. I receive too many of these emails to answer any in any detail, but if I ever get an email with "I am interested in AI/ Robotics. This is what I've done so far. Here is the code. I am stuck at point X. I tried A, B, C nothing worked. What you wrote at [url] suggests you may be the right person to ask. can you help?" I would pay much more attention than to a "please mentor me" email.

**In other words, when you asks for a busy person's time for "mentorship" or "advice" or whatever, show (a) you are serious and have gone as far as you can by yourself (b) have taken concrete steps to address whatever your needs are and (optionally. but especially with code related efforts)(c) how helping you could benefit them/their project.**

Good developers are very busy and have so much stuff happening in their lives and more work than they could ever hope to complete that they really don't have any time to answer vague emails from some one they've never heard of before.

As an (exaggerated) analogy, think of writing an email to a famous director or movie star or rock star, saying "I have these cool ideas about directing/acting/ music. Can you mentor me/give me advice?"

I am replacing the words "app" and "technical" in your sentence below with "film" and "film making".

"if I have an idea for a film that I want to develop, but my film making skills limit me, it would be nice to have people to bounce the idea off and have it implemented. "(so .. please mentor me/give me advice/make this film for me).

Do you think a top grade director (say Spielberg) would respond to this?

The fact that you at least got a 2 line response shows that the developers you wrote to are much nicer than you may think. They care enough not to completely dismiss your email, though they receive dozens of similar emails a week.

As someone else advised you on this thread, just roll up your sleeves and get to work. If your work is good enough, you'll get all the "mentoring" you'll need. "Mentoring" from the best people in your field is a very rare and precious resource and like anything else in life that is precious, should be earned.

My 2 cents. Fwiw. YMMV.* 

那说了我想说的大部分。

现在是一些小问题，解决最近邮件中提出的一些问题。

如果你声称“非常热爱 X ”,但从未在 X 做过任何具体的事情，我觉得很难把你当回事。真正对任何事情都充满热情的人不会等到“领导”或“导师”来了才在他们所热爱的领域做具体的工作，无论多么有限。特别是在互联网时代的编程/机器学习等方面，在亚马逊或麻省理工开放式课程这样的网站上，除了那些你强加给自己的限制之外，你没有任何限制。

我讨厌听起来像禅宗大师，但以我的经验来看，确实如此

**doing**

教你下一步需要做什么的工作。沿着小路走可以看到更多的地图。一个真正专心致志的学生所需要的指导，只是偶尔在这里轻轻一推，或者偶尔在那里发出简短的警告。与不确定性打交道是学习的一部分。等待导师/领导/“社区”[1]无论什么开始工作都是一个缺陷，它保证你永远不会取得任何有价值的成就。

好吧，伪禅宗大师模式关闭。更平淡无奇的版本——“闭嘴，编码”。或者用你的摄像头拍一部电影，或者写一部小说。随便啦。你的“工作”最终会给你带来所有的指导和社区，或者你需要的任何东西。

一如既往，我的 2 美分。Fwiw。YMMV。祝你有愉快的一天。

[1]由于某种原因，班加罗尔挤满了那些首先想组成一个社区，然后开始学习/工作/诸如此类的人。这些努力几乎总是徒劳地逐渐消失。首先做工作。然后，如果你想“交流”,就和其他同样努力工作的人谈谈。请阅读
