<font size="2" face="verdana">2011 年 3 月

昨天弗雷德·威尔逊发表了一篇关于失踪 [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) 的卓越[帖子。风投总是错过好的创业公司，但很少有人在很久之后才公开谈论它。所以这个帖子进一步证明了弗雷德是一只多么稀有的鸟。他可能是我认识的最好的风投。

看了 Fred 的帖子，让我回过头去看当时和他交流的邮件，试图说服他投资 Airbnb。读起来很有趣。你可以看到弗雷德在考虑这笔交易时的想法。

弗雷德和 Airbnb 的创始人已经慷慨地同意让我发表这封电子邮件(其中有一句话是关于对 Airbnb 具有战略重要性的事情，而不是对话的重要部分)。这是一个有趣的例子，展示了创业生态系统中的一个元素，除了参与者之外，很少有人见过这个元素:投资者试图说服彼此投资他们投资的公司。现在有成百上千的这种类型的对话正在发生，但是如果有一个被发表，我还没有看到。Airbnbs 夫妇自己当时甚至从未看过这些电子邮件。我们在 YC 做了很多这种幕后工作，因为我们投资了如此多的公司，而且我们投资得如此之早，以至于投资者有时需要大量的说服才能看清它们的价值。不过，我并不总是这么努力。弗雷德一定觉得我很讨厌。

One of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,
is in NYC right now meeting their users.  (NYC is their biggest
market.) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.

I'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to
do really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would
never go for it.  But then I thought maybe I should give you more
credit.  You'll certainly like meeting them.  Be sure to ask about
how they funded themselves with breakfast cereal.

There's no reason this couldn't be as big as Ebay.  And this team
is the right one to do it.

It's a longshot, at this stage, but if there was any VC who'd get
you guys, it would be Fred.  He is the least suburban-golf-playing
VC I know.

He likes to observe startups for a while before acting, so don't
be bummed if he seems ambivalent.

Thanks Paul

We are having a bit of a debate inside our partnership about the
airbed concept. We'll finish that debate tomorrow in our weekly
meeting and get back to you with our thoughts

Thanks

I'd recommend having the debate after meeting them instead of before.
We had big doubts about this idea, but they vanished on meeting the
guys.

We are still very suspect of this idea but will take a meeting as
you suggest

Thanks

Airbed team -

Are you still in NYC?

We'd like to meet if you are

Thanks

Ideas can morph.  Practically every really big startup could say,
five years later, "believe it or not, we started out doing ___."
It just seemed a very good sign to me that these guys were actually
on the ground in NYC hunting down (and understanding) their users.
On top of several previous good signs.

It's interesting

Our two junior team members were enthusiastic

The three "old guys" didn't get it

The Airbeds just won the first poll among all the YC startups in
their batch by a landslide.  In the past this has not been a 100%
indicator of success (if only anything were) but much better than
random.

I met them today

They have an interesting business

I'm just not sure how big it's going to be

Did they explain the long-term goal of being the market in accommodation
the way eBay is in stuff?  That seems like it would be huge.  Hotels
now are like airlines in the 1970s before they figured out how to
increase their load factors.

They did but I am not sure I buy that

ABNB reminds me of Etsy in that it facilitates real commerce in a
marketplace model directly between two people

So I think it can scale all the way to the bed and breakfast market

But I am not sure they can take on the hotel market

I could be wrong

But even so, if you include short term room rental, second home
rental, bed and breakfast, and other similar classes of accommodations,
you get to a pretty big opportunity

So invest in them!  They're very capital efficient.  They would
make an investor's money go a long way.

It's also counter-cyclical.  They just arrived back from NYC, and
when I asked them what was the most significant thing they'd observed,
it was how many of their users actually needed to do these rentals
to pay their rents.

There's a lot to like

I've done a few things, like intro it to my friends at Foundry who
were investors in Service Metrics and understand this model

I am also talking to my friend Mark Pincus who had an idea like
this a few years ago.

So we are working on it

Thanks for the lead

subject: airbnb already spreading to pros

I know you're skeptical they'll ever get hotels, but there's a
continuum between private sofas and hotel rooms, and they just moved
one step further along it.

[link to an airbnb user]

This is after only a few months.  I bet you they will get hotels
eventually.  It will start with small ones.  Just wait till all the
10-room pensiones in Rome discover this site.  And once it spreads
to hotels, where is the point (in size of chain) at which it stops?
Once something becomes a big marketplace, you ignore it at your
peril.

That's true. It's also true that there are quite a few marketplaces
out there that serve this same market

If you look at many of the people who list at ABNB, they list
elsewhere too

I am not negative on this one, I am interested, but we are still
in the gathering data phase.
